Reading Questions Answer Checker
--------------------------------

To check your answers put them in the appropriate box and click the 'Check' button. Every checker box can do arithmetic and calculate standard functions (see {{% resource_link 758ceee0-d290-5d7c-5072-7d458581a3b3 "calculator help" %}}). If you give decimal answers, give them to at least 3 decimal places.

As you work you should have pencil and paper handy for calculations and thinking!

Note: some questions ask for a formula. For the checker we ask you to plug a value into the formula. For your pset you still need to give the whole formula.

//DEBUG PARAMETERS //Because we don't show solutions for pset checkers we use //this to give a showanswer button during the debugging phase var debugans = undefined; //release //var debugans = kDebugAnswer; //debug problemNumber = 0; wl("\<h3>Calculator\</h3>"); writecalculator("psetcheckcalcid", "Calculate"); whr(kdivcol,kdivwid);
