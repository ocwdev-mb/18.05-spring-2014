  caption: 'The walls of our [Technology-Enabled Active Learning classroom](http://web.mit.edu/edtech/casestudies/teal.html)
    are lined with whiteboards. There are twelve projectors with screens distributed
    around the classroom. In between screens, cameras are positioned to capture activity
    at the white boards. The cameras allowed us to live-stream the activity at a whiteboard
    to the screens. When lecturing, we used either twelve screens to display the current
    slide, or six screens for slides and six screens to show the instructor speaking
    and writing at a whiteboard. This way, all students had a clear view of the slides,
    instructor, and whiteboard.


    We encouraged student participation during lecture snippets by frequently asking
    questions and eagerly discussing questions posed by students.'
