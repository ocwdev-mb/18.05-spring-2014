  caption: 'Every class was staffed with two instructors and three assistants (one
    instructor, one graduate student, and two undergraduate students.) The instructors
    and assistants circulated around the room to see how students were approaching
    the problems and where students were getting stuck. When helping, we paid extra
    attention to groups that were struggling to make progress and sometimes asked
    more challenging follow-up questions to groups that finished quickly. We wanted
    to get everyone to about the same point so that we could discuss the solution
    productively as a class.


    In most introductory-level math courses at MIT, problem sets include a mix of
    drill problems and more challenging problems. Because we worked through so many
    problems in class and to some extent on the reading questions, we were able to
    focus the problem sets on challenging problems.'
