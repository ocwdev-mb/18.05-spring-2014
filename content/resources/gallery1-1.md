  caption: 'This course served as an elementary introduction to probability and statistics
    for non-math majors who will encounter statistics in their professional lives.


    As students entered the classroom for Tuesday and Thursday class sessions, they
    were typically greeted with an xkcd comic related to the topic(s) for the day.'
