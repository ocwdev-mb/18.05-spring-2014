  caption: "We were sometimes able to facilitate the students\u2019 work in creative\
    \ ways. In this image, for example, we projected a likelihood table onto the whiteboards\
    \ so that students could construct confidence intervals without needing to first\
    \ copy down the table.\n\nAlthough students spent considerable time working on\
    \ board problems, this iteration of the course covered as much or more material\
    \ than past versions of the course. The key difference was that instead of instructors\
    \ working out examples on the board, students worked on problems themselves. We\
    \ believe it\u2019s much more beneficial for students to work out one example\
    \ than for them to watch an instructor work out two. When they worked on the problems\
    \ themselves, they could quickly identify what they did not understand and seek\
    \ help."

  image-alt: Small groups of students gather around whiteboards and work together
    on solving math problems. The students work directly on likelihood tables that
    are projected onto the whiteboards.
