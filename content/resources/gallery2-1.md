  caption: 'Students were expected to complete assigned readings and reading questions
    before class. In class, we taught under the assumption that the students had done
    the readings. Lectures were brief summaries, kept short to allow ample time for
    active student work. We usually tried to have the students working on a problem
    within the first 15 minutes of class.


    For each class session, we created a slide deck that contained lecture content
    as well as problems for the students to work on. After class, we added problem
    solutions to the slide deck and posted them online for student use.'
