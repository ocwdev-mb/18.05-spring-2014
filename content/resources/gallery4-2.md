  caption: "We had the students work on the whiteboards in groups of three. The physical\
    \ act of standing up served many purposes. Students were more focused without\
    \ the distraction of their computers and smartphones. They were energized by physically\
    \ changing positions. Sharing whiteboard space encouraged conversation and collaboration.\
    \ Students could also look at each other\u2019s work for hints and ideas, and\
    \ we could easily observe their strategies and progress. Working at the whiteboards\
    \ was a huge part of the course.\n\nFor board problems, the physical classroom\
    \ was fantastic. There was ample room for students to rapidly get out of their\
    \ seats, find board space, work on a problem comfortably, and get back in their\
    \ seats.\n\nStudents learned a lot from each other, especially when they discussed\
    \ their ideas as a group. If one student had a stronger understanding of the material,\
    \ that student might take the lead on a particular problem. Students were also\
    \ able to look at other students\u2019 work or interact with other groups if they\
    \ were stuck."
